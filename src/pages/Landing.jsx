        <p className="about1">Welcome to Cruxx! We are a passionate team of three 19-year-old college students who understand the challenge of maintaining habits, despite their undeniable benefits. We realized that while motivation is essential, true discipline is vital for lasting change. One of the most effective ways to cultivate discipline is through instant gratificationâ€”celebrating each small victory as we complete our habits.
        <br></br><br></br>In our quest for effective habit-building strategies, we scoured the internet, exploring countless websites and absorbing various perspectives. However, we quickly discovered that existing solutions didn't fully cater to our needs. This realization sparked a new idea: why not create a platform ourselves? And thus, Cruxx was born.</p>
        
        <img src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/abtus.jpg`} alt="ABOUT US2" className="b2" />
        <p className="about2">At Cruxx, we offer a gamified habit tracker designed to make the journey of building habits enjoyable. In a digital world, we strive to harness technology to its fullest potential. Many of our friends are avid gamers and inspired us to incorporate a gaming twist into our habit tracker, making it engaging and motivating for users of all ages.
        <br></br><br></br>Our mission is to provide a platform where individuals can track their habits while experiencing the joy of accomplishment. With the right tools, habit-building can become an exciting adventure, and we're thrilled to embark on this journey with you. Join us as we explore the dynamic intersection of technology, personal development, and gaming, turning the challenge of habit formation into a rewarding experience!</p>
